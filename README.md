# TECPasscodeManager

TECPasscodeManager is a drop-in all-in-one Touch ID and passcode manager to secure your app. Its interface is meant to mimic the lock screen passcode input on iOS 7 and above as closely as possible.

TECPasscodeViewController is based on code from [kosyloa/PinPad](https://github.com/kosyloa/PinPad), [infakt/PinPad](https://github.com/infakt/PinPad), and [Busta117/PinPad](https://github.com/Busta117/PinPad).


## Usage

See the PasscodeTest demo project included in this repository for a working example of the project.


## Requirements

TECPasscodeManager works on iOS 7 and above.
